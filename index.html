                <h2>GREETINGS!</h2>
                <p>You are about to become involved in an exciting spiritual exercise. God has given 
                    you one or more spiritual gifts if you are a Christian, and discovering that gift or gifts will 
                    be a thrilling experience. 
                     You will be asked to answer the 125 questions found in the Wagner “Modified 
                    Houts Questionnaire.” This spiritual gifts discovery instrument was originally suggested 
                    by Dr. Richard F. Houts, a professor in the North American Baptist Theological 
                    Seminary, in 1976. Subsequently it has been modified by C. Peter Wagner of the Charles 
                    E. Fuller Institute of Evangelism and Church Growth., and keyed in to his classic book, 
                    Your Spiritual Gifts Can Help Your Church Grow, now the best selling book in the field 
                    of spiritual gifts. The copy you have in your hand is the fifth edition and the first 
                    complete revision of the original published version. 
                     Thousands and thousands of believers have been blessed by taking the Modified 
                    Houts Questionnaire. Constant feedback from them has enabled us to refine it to the point 
                    where it will give you a fairly accurate picture of what kind of ministry God expects you 
                    to be carrying out in your group of believers. 
                     However, do not regard the results of this test as final. The three or four gifts you 
                    score highest in may or may not be your spiritual gifts. But you can be sure in any case 
                    that they are a starting point for prayer and experimentation. You will need other 
                    members of the body of Christ to help you confirm what gifts you have. 
                     An excellent use of this questionnaire is to fill it in as part of the “Spiritual Gifts 
                    Discovery Workshop” offered by the Fuller Institute. A pastor or teacher in your church 
                    can administer this workshop, and the Fuller Institute provides all instructional materials 
                    needed by both teacher and participant.
